Place your pc games folders in this directory!

The folder should have the same name as the rest of the files, the only difference should be the extension.

You MUST have these:
*.exe (This is your game executable)
*.png (This is your games thumbnail in the program)

You can also have these:
*.txt (Here you can put info about your game or anything realy)
*.mp3 (If you want to have a theme song or anything playing while the user is looking at your game)
*Title.png (If you want a custom title for your game add "Title" to the end of the gamename and the extension must be .png (Its height is recommended to be a maximum of 128px))

The name of all the files will be your title in the program.
So if you name your folder and files to "Awesome Game" the title in the program would be "Awesome Game".
